<p><b>Thanks for your interest in a Code for America Brigade in your community.</b></p>
<p>In the meantime, weâ€™ll keep in touch about opportunities to participate in activities at the national level.</p>
<p>Remember, if you change your mind, you can always come back to sign up to be an organizer and take a more proactive role.</p>
<p>Good luck and we'll be in touch.</p>
